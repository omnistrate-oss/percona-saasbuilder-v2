        {orgName} Privacy Policy Abstract
      </SectionHeading>
      <SectionDescription>
        Privacy matters, so we try to keep it simple. The true, legal privacy
        policy is below, but in an effort to push plain-language communication,
        we wanted to include an abstract. Like most websites and web services,
        we directly and indirectly collect some information about you. We do so
        in order to communicate with you and to try to make our service the best
        it can be. We respect your privacy and only share your information when
        the business requires it (e.g. payment processing). Your personal
        information is not a monetization channel for us. We may use it to learn
        and share what we&apos;ve learned about analytics, but all personally
        identifiable information will be stripped from that dataset. Cool?
        Again, this is just an abstract. The nitty gritty is listed below. If
        you think our abstract is inconsistent with our policy, let us know. We
        really want to be on the up and up.

        and last name and e-mail address. If you send us feedback, send us an
        email or contact us via the Service, we will collect any Personal Data
        in that feedback, email or contact. If you participate in one of our
        surveys or request a demo, we may collect additional Personal Data from
        you. We may combine Personal Data submitted by you with information
        obtained from other sources. Like most websites,
        {orgName} collects certain information from you automatically, such as
        your Internet protocol address, browser type, operating system, and
        access time. We also use cookies and navigational data like Uniform
        Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding your use of the
        Service. A &quot;cookie&quot; is a small data file placed on your hard
        drive when you visit certain websites. You may disable cookies by
        adjusting the preferences settings of your browser. Consult the
        &quot;Help&quot; feature of your browser for specific instructions. If
